    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
       <p>Boil shrimp according to our 3-minute boiled shrimp recipe then immediately cool in ice water and cut shrimp in half lengthwise.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
       <p>Cook noodles according to package instructions until softened (do not overcook) rinse in a colander with cold water and drain well. Our method: fill a saucepan with water and bring to a boil, add the noodles, turn off the heat and let them sit in hot water for 5-7 minutes.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
       <p>Prep veggies – julienne cucumbers and carrots, remove stiff stems on lettuce leaves, coarsely chop cilantro,</p>
       <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
       <p>Assemble spring rolls one at a time. Fill a shallow round bowl with very warm/hot water. Submerge spring roll wrapper for about 10-15 seconds or until softened. Place wrapper on a lightly wet cutting board.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
       <p>Add veggies – on the bottom half layer a piece of lettuce, a generous pinch of noodles, some carrots, cucumber, and cilantro sprigs.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
       <p>Add shrimp – On the second half place halved shrimp with cut-side up.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
       <p>Tightly roll up the lettuce side first, tuck in the sides then roll over the shrimp and finish rolling.</p>
